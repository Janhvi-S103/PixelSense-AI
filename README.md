# 🧠 PixelSense-AI

**PixelSense-AI** is an intelligent image processing application that leverages machine learning to deliver **content-aware pixelation**. Unlike traditional pixelation techniques that apply a uniform blur across the image, PixelSense-AI uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to identify and preserve important visual elements—pixelating only where it truly matters.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input Image** → User uploads an image.
2. **CNN Inference** → The model analyzes the image to determine important vs. less important regions.
3. **Adaptive Pixelation** → Applies pixelation selectively based on analysis.
4. **Output Image** → Processed image is returned in real-time.
