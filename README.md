## PixelSense-AI
PixelSense AI is an intelligent image processing application that uses machine learning to perform content-aware pixelation. Unlike traditional pixelation that uniformly blocks out images, PixelSense AI analyzes image content using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine which areas need more or less pixelation. This smart approach helps preserve important image elements while providing stronger pixelation in less significant areas.

Key Features:

- Content-aware processing using CNN
- Adaptive pixelation levels
- User-friendly interface
- Real-time image processing
- Automatic importance detection

Applications:

- Privacy protection in photos
- Artistic image effects
- Data anonymization
- Educational demonstrations of AI/ML concepts

Technical Stack:

- PyTorch for deep learning
- Python for backend processing
- PIL for image handling
- Google Colab for deployment

This project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning in image processing while maintaining simplicity and usability for end users. It's an excellent example of how AI can enhance traditional image manipulation techniques.
